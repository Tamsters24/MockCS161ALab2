# MockCS161ALab2
For this lab, you will write a program that displays the change for an item whose value is less than $1.00. The item will be purchased using
exactly $1.00, and your task is to print a statement to the screen that displays the change after purchase. The change will be using quarters,
dimes, nickles, and pennies. Your program should produce change that uses the fewest coins possible. For example:
### Output for a purchase: item's value is 67 cents
```
The price of your item is 67 cents, and your change is 33 cents.
Here's the change that uses the fewest coins:
    pennies: 3
    nickels: 1
    dimes: 0
    quarters: 1
```
### Output for a purchase: item's value is 14 cents
```
The price of your item is 1 cents, and your change is 99 cents.
Here's the change that uses the fewest coins:
    pennies: 4
    nickels: 0
    dimes: 2
    quarters: 3
```
