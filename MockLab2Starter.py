# Requirements:
# * You must have variables named:
#       price, change, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
# * You may include any additional variables you choose.
# * In your finished code, put all print statements at the bottom
#   (as indicated by the comment).
# * You may use print statements elsewhere in your code while you are developing
#   and testing, but you should comment out those print statements before submission.


# once you have a working solution, you should change this line to test other
# starting values, e.g., 68 cents, 69 cents, etc. to ensure that your calculations
# work for each value.
price = 67

# do all of your computations using the provided variables here:
#change =
#quarters =
#dimes =
#nickels =
#pennies =

# put all print statements in this section:
print('The price is', price,'cents.' )
